### Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹

I code often, believe it or not. My latest gig is I finished my Computer Science degree (Oct 2020) and I'm searching for my next step, a career path in Software Engineering or Research (Industry/University).

I like making as many useful things with Python and Java as humanly possible.

I love sports and photography. Also nature. I work at Nokia Software as an intern, too :) If you would like to discuss these things with me, you create an issue [here](https://github.com/NaseemSrour/NaseemSrour) so we can chat further.
