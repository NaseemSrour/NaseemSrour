### Hello, nerds 👋

I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I finished my Computer Science degree (Oct 2020) and I'm searching for my next step, probably a career path, maybe in Research (University), maybe in Software Engineering (Industry).
<br>I like making as many useful things with Python and Java as humanly possible.

I'm currently exploring more fields of interest beyond the B.Sc., by learning about new areas in Computer Science, like AI.

I love sports and photography. Also nature. I work at Nokia Software as an intern, too. If you would like to discuss these things with me, you can find more info on my humble [website](https://naseemsr.wixsite.com/naseem).
