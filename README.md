### Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹

You've reached your destination!
I'm Naseem, and my latest gig is I finished my Computer Science degree (Oct 2020) and I'm searching for my next step, a career path in Software Engineering or Research (Industry/University).

I like making as many useful things with Python and Java as humanly possible.

I love sports and photography. Also nature. I work at Nokia Software as an intern, too :) If you would like to discuss these things with me, you can create an issue [here](https://github.com/NaseemSrour/NaseemSrour) & we can chat further!
