### Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹


I'm Naseem, a Computer Scientist from Tel-Aviv University.

I like making as many useful things with Python and Java as humanly possible. <br>
I currently work at Nokia Software as an intern :) <br> If you would like to discuss anything with me, you can create an issue [here](https://github.com/NaseemSrour/NaseemSrour) & we can chat further!
